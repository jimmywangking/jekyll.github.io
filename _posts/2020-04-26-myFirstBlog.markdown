If you want to get free to use IDEA to develop/build your Java project, you have to get an licence to use some features in IDEA, otherwise the functions will be limited. But you might know, the licence fee is more than 1000 per year, ah ohhh, i'm not a rich man. Then i will tell you how to get it for free.

1. You should have a mailbox, and better a microsoft one, because it's international, and will not block some mails(-_-).

2. You have to be a student and get your school mailbox. Maybe you could request to study in a U.S. university, like CCC, why not ^_^

3. After you became a student, then Jet Brains will grant you the authorization to use their softwares, a series of IDE including most of popular development lauguages. And for sure, they will validate your information manually, so provide your student ID, school name, etc.

4. Normally the JB manually valition will take one day to one week, then just pray: God bless you, kid.
