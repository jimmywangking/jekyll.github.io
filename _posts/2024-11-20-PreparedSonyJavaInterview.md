**Situation**: “In my previous project, we had a change request to enhance the reporting feature, which was used by the marketing team.”  
**Task**: “I was tasked with refactoring the existing code and implementing new functionalities while ensuring the system remained stable.”  
**Action**: “I first gathered detailed requirements, then worked on the codebase, adding new reporting features while keeping the original functionality intact. I also implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.”  
**Result**: “The marketing team was able to generate reports 30% faster, and the new feature was well-received by the stakeholders. Additionally, the automated pipeline improved our deployment process.”  

By focusing on these aspects, you will communicate effectively during a Java maintenance and development (change requests) project interview and demonstrate your expertise in handling real-world project challenges.
